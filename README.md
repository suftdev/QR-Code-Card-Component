## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties

### What I learned

I learned a lot about the basic concepts of the CSS styles, styles like "max-width, margin, object-fit" and many others.
Also importantly, making sure the mobile screen works even at deployment.

```html
<p class="mobile">
  Scan the QR code to visit Frontend Mentor and take your coding skills to the
  next level
</p>
```

```css
#container {
  max-width: 270px;
  margin: 80 auto;
}
```

### Continued development

Going forward, I want to do more challenge, to cement my css understanding and get to work with javascript dom methods next.

### Useful resources

- [Mobile Responsive Design](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/CSS_layout/Responsive_Design) - This helped me for responsive design. I really liked this article and will give a complete read in the future.
